API at http://127.0.0.1/urlinfo/1/ looks into a table stored on a MySQL database for the URL of a new site to learn if the site is flagged as Malware.

The new site URL is added to the end of the API URL endpoint.  For example:

http://127.0.0.1/urlinfo/1/wwww.espn.com will return false, meaning it was not found in the malware table list.
http://127.0.0.1/urlinfo/1/wwww.evilmalware.com will return true, Meaning it was found in the malware table list.

Website uses Python 3.9.  Built with django, djangorestframework and MySQL.
